# Biased Heritage

Code for the paper "Biased Heritage: How Datasets Shape Models in Facial Expression Recognition".

Currently only the novel implementation of bias metrics has been uploaded (`model_bias_metrics.py`), as well as the code for the associated figure in the paper (`main.ipynb`). We will soon upload code for the rest of the experiments.

## Dependencies

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management. To install dependendencies, simply `cd` into the folder and run `uv sync`.
